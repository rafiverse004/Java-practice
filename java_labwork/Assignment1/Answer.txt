Question:
You have to explain how you have achieved the θ(n) for the best-case scenario in
a comment block of your code.

Answer:
Bubble Sort – Best Case Complexity.
When the array is already sorted, no swapping is required. 
The boolean flag 'swapped' stays false during the first pass. 
The algorithm detects this and breaks immediately, so only one pass is done.

Comparisons = n-1, Swaps = 0
Therefore, time complexity in this case is θ(n).
